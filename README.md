# Garbage Detect

Garbage Detect is a litter detection, monitoring, and notification system.

## Usage

Installing dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running:

```
python3 src/app.py
```

Developing front-end:

```
npx tailwindcss -i src/static/styles.css -o src/static/generated-styles.css -mw
```

Of course, you'd have to have TailwindCSS installed for that:

```
npm install -D tailwindcss
```
